# Traveller Tools
Tools for playing Traveller (CT)

## NOTE
This repo contains code that is unlikely to work. I've been using the RPG game Traveller for many years as a programming task for learning new languages and frameworks. It'll probably only be of interest to me.

The things I'm trying to learn here are:
* [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) with the [AngulaJS generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular#readme) lets you quickly set up a project with sensible defaults and best practices.
* [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) HTML enhanced for web apps.
* [Slim](http://www.slimframework.com) a micro framework for PHP.
